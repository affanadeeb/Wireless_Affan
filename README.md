### **1. Introduction**
- **Focus:** Establishes the context of SLAM and highlights the inconsistency problem with EKF-based SLAM.
- **Why this section?** It lays the groundwork for understanding why inconsistency in EKF is critical to SLAM's reliability.
- **Transition to Next Topic:** Since inconsistency affects the performance, the paper progresses to analyze the root cause through observability theory.

---

### **2. SLAM Observability Analysis**
- **Focus:** Discusses observability, a fundamental property for state estimation, and examines the nonlinear SLAM system's observability. It then compares this with the observability properties of the EKF linearized model.
- **Key Insights:**
  - The nonlinear SLAM system is unobservable with three degrees of freedom (position and orientation of the global frame).
  - The standard EKF incorrectly assumes higher observability, introducing inconsistency.
- **Why this section?** To identify how EKF's inconsistency originates from flawed observability assumptions.
- **Transition to Next Topic:** Moves towards solving this inconsistency by introducing a new approach to EKF formulation.

### **3. First Estimates Jacobian (FEJ)-EKF**
- **Focus:** Proposes a modified EKF algorithm, FEJ-EKF, which maintains observability consistency.
- **Key Features:**
  - Uses the initial estimates of state variables for Jacobian computation rather than continuously updating them.
  - Aligns the EKF's observable subspace with that of the nonlinear system.
- **Why this section?** To present a concrete solution to the inconsistency problem identified earlier.
- **Transition to Next Topic:** Evaluates the performance of FEJ-EKF against standard EKF and other alternatives.

---

### **4. Simulation Results**
- **Focus:** Validates the theoretical claims through extensive Monte Carlo simulations across different SLAM scenarios.
- **Key Findings:**
  - FEJ-EKF performs almost as well as the ideal EKF (oracle version) in accuracy and consistency.
  - It outperforms the standard EKF and robocentric mapping in terms of consistency.
- **Why this section?** Demonstrates the practical advantages of FEJ-EKF.
- **Transition to Next Topic:** Summarizes the conclusions and implications of the work.

---

### **5. Conclusions**
- **Focus:** Recaps the contributions, theoretical findings, and the effectiveness of the FEJ-EKF.
- **Why this section?** Provides a closure, emphasizing the importance of consistent filtering for SLAM and suggesting directions for future research.

2. Analyzes its root cause using observability.
3. Proposes a solution (FEJ-EKF).
4. Validates the solution with simulations.
5. Summarizes and concludes.
