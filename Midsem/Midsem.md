# Wireless Communication
## Mid-Semester Examination - Monsoon 2024

**Date**: 21 September 2024  
**Time**: 04:30 pm to 06:00 pm  
**Total Marks**: 40

### Instructions:
1. All questions are compulsory.
2. A cheat sheet of one side of A4 page is allowed for the formulas only. Submit the cheat sheet along with the answer sheet.
3. A scientific calculator is allowed; any other type of electronics devices are not permitted.
4. Clearly state the assumptions (if any) made that are not specified in the question.

### Question 1 [3x5=15]
Consider that the transmitter and receiver has the perfect knowledge of the channel state information and its distribution. Derive the ergodic capacity and also explain the transceiver architecture to achieve this capacity.

### Question 2 [3x5=15]
Answer any three of the following questions:

a) Assume that the wireless channel with a bandwidth of 30 kHz has three possible received SNR levels:
   - γ₁ = 0.8333 with probability p(γ₁) = 0.1
   - γ₂ = 83.33 with probability p(γ₂) = 0.5
   - γ₃ = 333.33 with probability p(γ₃) = 0.4
   Find the ergodic capacity of this channel for the system considered in Q1.

b) Derive the low-pass equivalents of received signal and channel impulse response.

c) Explain what is scattering function of wireless channel and how it is useful to determine the Doppler spread.

d) Assume that the lowpass equivalent of a narrowband signal received at two antennas are:
   
   y₁ = h₁x + w₁,  
   y₂ = h₂x + w₂,

   where h_i's are complex channel coefficients, x is transmit signal with power P, and w_i is AWGN noise with variance σ²_w. Find the signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs) for individual antennas and also suggest a way to combine y₁ and y₂ to maximize the overall SNR.

### Question 3 [5x2=10]
Answer any five of the following questions briefly:

a) State the combined simplified path loss and shadowing model.

b) Find maximum Doppler speed when receiver is moving at 100 Kmph and is receiving a single tone at frequency 1 GHz.

c) What is ergodic capacity?

d) State the auto-correlation function of the output of wireless channel r(t) and comment on the relationship between coherence time and velocity.

e) State what is outage capacity and comment on the optimal threshold.

f) Explain what is inter-symbol interference in wideband channel.

**ALL THE BEST!**
